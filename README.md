# Ensemble-UNet-Enhancing-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

In this project, we employ an ensemble learning approach by integrating four pre-trained networks: MobileNet, DeepLabV3+, ResNet, and DenseNet as the encoders within the U-Net architecture. Our experimental evaluation showcases promising results, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.86, a Dice Coefficient (DC) of 0.92, and an accuracy of approximately 0.99. These results emphasize the effectiveness of our proposed U-Net-based architecture and ensemble learning approach for accurate brain tumor segmentation.
